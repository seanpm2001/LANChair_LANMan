# LANChair: LANMan

`üè°Ô∏èü™ëÔ∏èüë¥Ô∏è The LANMan (or Old Man) is a component of the LANChair software that allows you to kick people off your LAN, or let them use it. It is written in D. Now git off my LAN!`

## Kick

There are 2 ways to get someone off your LAN:

**Request:**

- Button:Get off my LAN!

> An additional message can be added, the above text is just the title of the message.

**Force:**

- Button:Git off my LAN!

> An additional message can be added, the above text is just the title of the message.

## Trivia

Before this project was published onto GitHub, LANMan was known as Old Man. This is in reference to a common joke in media where an old man yells at kids to get off his lawn. A pun is at play here, since LAN is pronounced similarly to lawn, the motto of the kick feature is `"get off my LAN"` and additionally `"git off my LAN"` (in reference to the Git version control system) the term Old Man is still in use, but LANMan is the official name now.
